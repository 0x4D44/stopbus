Stopbus v1.11 for Windows is a card game. The object of the game is to remain 
playing for as long as possible and you are pitted against three computer
players who have every intention of stopping you doing so. The game comes
with a fully functional help file which explains the operation of the game
in detail. This version replaces v1.1 which didn't (for some strange
reason) include the CTL3D library. The program and help file now reflect
this change.
  

It requires CTL3D, the MicroSoft 3D library which is included.
