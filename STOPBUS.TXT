STOPBUS.TXT
===========       

This file is a part of the archive STOPBUS.ZIP which should contain four (4)
files. They are:

(1)  STOPBUS.TXT  (this file)
(2)  STOPBUS.EXE  (main executable)
(3)  STOPBUS.HLP  (help file)
(4)  CTl3D.DLL    (MicroSoft's 3D library)

To install simply copy these four files into a suitable subdirectory (such
as C:\STOPBUS). If you are using Windows' Program Manager as a shell the
following instructions will install the program icon:

1) Select Program Manager using ALT+TAB or by clicking on it.
2) Double click on the program group that you wish to add the icon to.
3) Select FILE|NEW... from the main menu.
4) Ensure that the 'Program item' radio button is selected in the 
   'New Program Object' dialog.
5) In the 'Program Item Properties' dialog enter the following information:
   'Description'= Stop the Bus
   'Command Line'= C:\STOPBUS\STOPBUS.EXE
6) Then click on OK. The program icon should now appear in the active group
   window.

You may wish to move the file CTL3D.DLL to the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory. However be careful not to replace a more modern version of
this file.


About this program
==================

The author:
-----------

Stop the Bus is a card game which I originally wrote last summer term
when I was in second year. Since then it has been debugged a bit and
has now been dragged out again as a "release" from revison for Finals.
I am presently working on a version of Estimation Whist and there are
one or two other things started but not finished. If you want more
information you can write to me at:

     Martin Davidson
     Hertford College

     United Kingdom

or you contact me via the internet:

     u91mgd@uk.ac.oxford.ecs OR
     u91mgd@ecs.ox.ac.uk	

Both of these addresses will be good until at least July 1995 when I graduate.
After that who knows???
